Documentation
==========

The Nmap project tries to defy the stereotype of some open source
software being poorly documented by providing a
comprehensive set of documentation for installing and using Nmap.
This page links to official Insecure.Org documentation, and generous
contributions from other parties.

Nmap Reference Guide
----------

The primary documentation for using Nmap is the [Nmap
Reference Guide](https://nmap.org/book/man.html). This is also the basis for the Nmap man page
([nroff version of nmap.1](https://nmap.org/data/nmap.1)). It is regularly
updated for each release and is meant to serve as a quick-reference
to virtually all Nmap command-line arguments, but you can learn even
more about Nmap by reading it straight through. The 18 sections
include [Brief
Options Summary](https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html), [Firewall/IDS
Evasion and Spoofing](https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html), [Timing
and Performance](https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html), [Port
Scanning Techniques](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html), [Usage Examples](https://nmap.org/book/man-examples.html), and much more.

The original Nmap manpage has been translated into 15 languages. That is fantastic, as it makes Nmap more accessible around the world. The following languages are now available:

* [<img alt="cn" height="32" src="https://nmap.org/images/flags/32/cn.png" class="flag" width="32">Chinese](https://nmap.org/man/zh/)

The links above go to the HTML guide. Nroff (man page format) and DocBook
XML (source) versions of each man page translation can be found [here](https://nmap.org/data/man-xlate/). If you would like to update one of our
existing translations or translate to a language **not** mentioned above,
please [read the instructions and FAQ](https://nmap.org/xlate-faq.html) and then [mail our developers](mailto:dev@nmap.org) or [open a pull request on Github](https://github.com/nmap/nmap). It is a
lot of work, but the reward is that thousands of
people may benefit from your translation every month.

Nmap Book
----------

[nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/)[nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/) is the official guide to
Nmap. From explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book
by Nmap's original author suits all levels of security and networking
professionals. The [reference guide](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)documents every Nmap feature and option, while the remainder
demonstrates how to apply them to quickly solve real-world
tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on the
wire. Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection
systems, optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking
tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine. More than half of the book is[available free
online](https://nmap.org/book/toc.html). It was written in English but [has already been translated to other languages](https://nmap.org/book/#translations).

Other Insecure.Org Documentation
----------

Installation is made easy by the detailed [Nmap Installation Guide](https://nmap.org/book/install.html). This covers topics such as [UNIX compilation and configure directives](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html) and Installing Nmap on [Linux](https://nmap.org/book/inst-linux.html),[Windows](https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html),[Mac OS X](https://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html),[Free/Open/NetBSD](https://nmap.org/book/inst-bsd.html),[Solaris](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html),[Amiga, and HP-UX](https://nmap.org/book/inst-other-platforms.html). It also covers [Nmap removal](https://nmap.org/book/inst-removing-nmap.html) in case you change your mind.

One of Nmap's most exciting new features is the [Nmap Scripting
Engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html), which extends Nmap's functionality using the simple and
efficient [Lua](https://lua.org/) programming language.
Nmap includes about 50
valuable scripts for network discovery and vulnerability detection,
and you can also write your own. We describe the system in depth
(from simple usage instructions to writing your own scripts) in our [NSE guide](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html). We also have an [NSE Documentation Portal](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/) which includes detailed documentation for every NSE script and library.

Fyodor regularly gives conference presentations covering advanced Nmap usage and new features. Audio, video, and/or slides for many of these are available on [his presentations page](https://nmap.org/presentations/).

Interested in how nmap uses TCP/IP fingerprinting for [remote OS
detection](https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html)? We have written a detailed article on the [2nd Generation Nmap OS Detection System](https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html). We also have an [old article about the 1st generation system](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-old.html), which people have generously translated into [French](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-fr.html), [Portuguese](http://www.absoluta.org/absoluta/seguranca/seg_detect_os.html),[Italian](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-it/stackf.html),[Russian](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-ru.html),[Spanish](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-mx.html),[German](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-de.html),[Japanese](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-jp.html),[Chinese](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-cn.html),[Traditional Chinese (Big5)](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-tw.html),[Turkish](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-tr.html),[Hebrew](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-il.html),[Indonesian](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-id.html),[Dutch](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-nl.html).[Polish](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-pl.html), and[Swedish](https://nmap.org/nmap-fingerprinting-article-se.html).

[Nmap Version Detection](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html): Instead of using a simple
nmap-services table lookup to determine a port's likely purpose, Nmap
will (if asked) interrogate that TCP or UDP port to determine what
service is really listening. In many cases it can determine the
application name and version number as well. Obstacles like SSL
encryption and Sun RPC are no threat, as Nmap can connect using
OpenSSL (if available) as well as utilizing Nmap's RPC
bruteforcer. IPv6 is also supported. Learn all about this great
feature in our [Version Detection Paper](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html)  

Nmap now has an official cross-platform GUI named [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/). It is included in most of the packages on
the Nmap download page. It is documented in the [Zenmap User's Guide](https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html). More information is
available from the [Zenmap site](https://nmap.org/zenmap/) and [Zenmap man page](https://nmap.org/zenmap/man.html).

One of the coolest, yet still relatively obscure features of Nmap
is the IPID Idle scan (-sI). Not only does this allow for a
completely blind portscan (no packets sent to the target from your
real IP), but it can even allow you to bypass packet filters in
certain circumstances. We wrote a [ Idle
scanning paper](https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html) describing this technique as well as several other
exploits based on predictable IPID sequence numbers. It includes
real-life examples as well as a section on defending yourself from
these techniques.

The most important changes (features,
bugfixes, etc) in each Nmap version are described in its [ChangeLog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html).

While it is now only of historical interest, Nmap was first released in a September 1, 1997 Phrack 51 Article titled [The Art of Port Scanning](https://nmap.org/p51-11.html)
