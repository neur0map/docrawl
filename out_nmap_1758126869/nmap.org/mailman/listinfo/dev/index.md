dev -- Nmap development work, early release announcements, & bug reports
==========

About dev
----------

The Nmap dev list is intended to facilitate the development of the free [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/). It provides an unmoderated forum for people to contribute ideas, patches, suggestions, etc. We also discuss the pros and cons of proposed changes to Nmap. Thus this list also serves as a sort of developmental "steering committee". New (test/beta) versions of Nmap may sometimes be released here prior to general availability for quality assurance purposes.  

Anyone hardcore enough to subscribe to nmap-dev should probably also subscribe to the [Nmap announcement list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce), a moderated list for Nmap-related announcements.  

This list is reasonably high volume (sometimes 10+ posts per day). Prior postings to the list are available at the [Nmap dev archives at Seclists.org](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/). Non-members can post, but such posts go through moderation to prevent spam.

Using dev
----------

To post a message to all the list members, send email to[dev@nmap.org](mailto:dev@nmap.org).

You can subscribe to the list, or change your existing
subscription, in the sections below.
