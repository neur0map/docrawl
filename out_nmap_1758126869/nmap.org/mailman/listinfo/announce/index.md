announce -- Occasional Nmap related announcements
==========

About announce
----------

Nmap-hackers is a low-traffic (1 or 2 messages per month) moderated list intended to spotlight new versions of [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and related projects. Announcements and news relating to port scanning, Insecure.Org, or Nmap author Fyodor may also be posted. Light discussion is permitted where particularly insightful, relevant, and interesting.  

An unmoderated [Nmap development list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev) is also available for hardcore Nmap enthusiasts who want to help shape its development. Nmap problem reports and most discussion should be sent there instead of to nmap-hackers.  

To view prior postings, visit the [Nmap-announce list archives](https://seclists.org/nmap-announce/) at Seclists.org.
