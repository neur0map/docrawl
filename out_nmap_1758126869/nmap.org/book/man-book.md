Nmap Book
----------

While this reference guide details all material Nmap options, it can't fully demonstrate how to apply those features to quickly solve real-world tasks. For that, we released [*Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning*](https://nmap.org/book/). Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems, optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided for common Nmap tasks such as taking network inventory, penetration testing, detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm outbreaks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on the wire. More than half of the book is available free online. See [`https://nmap.org/book`](https://nmap.org/book) for more information.
