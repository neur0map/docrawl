The IP address you are coming from has requested an inordinately large number of pages in a short amount of time and has been temporarily blocked to conserve our resources. This often happens when people try to use web spidering programs to download large portions of the site. The block will be removed 24 hours after the latest period of high traffic.

Purpose[]()[]()
----------

This document type definition (DTD) is used by XML parsers to
validate Nmap XML output. The latest version is always available at[`https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd`](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd). While it
is primarily intended for programmatic use, it is included here due to
its value in helping humans interpret Nmap XML output. The DTD
defines the legal elements of the format, and often enumerates the
attributes and values they can take on. Using the DTD is discussed
further in [the section called “XML Output (`-oX`)”](https://nmap.org/book/output-formats-xml-output.html).
