Request for Comments
----------

While I tried my best to make this book comprehensive, accurate,
and up-to-date, we all make mistakes. If you find any problems or
just have suggestions for making this book better, please let me know
by email at `<[fyodor@nmap.org](mailto:fyodor@nmap.org)>`. The open source
principle of many readers and contributors is just as viable for
documentation as for software. As the next section attests, dozens of
people have already generously contributed their time and skills to make this
book a success.

If you have a question or comment about Nmap (rather than this
book itself), it is best sent to the Nmap development list as described at[the section called “Bugs”](https://nmap.org/book/man-bugs.html).
